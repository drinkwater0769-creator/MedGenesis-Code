# ClinicalRepBench Task: Cardiology_002

You are evaluating an autonomous clinical-research agent on a redacted paper-reproduction task.

## Primary Question

Can an autonomous clinical-research agent reproduce the main analysis of PMID 38546334 (Large-scale plasma proteomics in the UK Biobank modestly improves prediction of major cardiovascular events in a population without previous cardiovascular disease) using UK Biobank or a governed benchmark extract?

## Required Work

1. Reconstruct the likely study design, analytic cohort, exposure or predictor, endpoint, covariates, and statistical analysis plan.
2. Produce a Re-Discovery analysis that tests whether the source study's main finding can be recovered.
3. Produce a New-Discovery analysis that identifies a plausible additional signal, subgroup, limitation, or deployment implication from the same evidence space.
4. Separate statistical significance from clinical significance.
5. Identify assumptions, missingness, confounding, bias, data leakage risk, and generalizability limits.
6. Do not infer causality unless the design and assumptions justify it.

## Clinical Task Frame

- Domain: Cardiology
- Endpoint: major cardiovascular events predicted by plasma proteomics in UK Biobank
- Re-Discovery target: Reconstruct the source study analysis for: major cardiovascular events predicted by plasma proteomics in UK Biobank. Declare any deviations or missing modules.
- New-Discovery target: Perform one prespecified, data-supported sensitivity or subgroup analysis; distinguish it from source reproduction and report uncertainty.
